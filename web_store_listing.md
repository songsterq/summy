🌀 Tired of drowning in a sea of tabs? Wish you could get the gist of an article without reading every. single. word?

Summy is a super-smart Chrome extension that uses the power of ChatGPT to summarize any webpage or selected text in a flash. Whether you're a student, a researcher, or just a curious mind, Summy helps you cut through the noise and get straight to the good stuff.
